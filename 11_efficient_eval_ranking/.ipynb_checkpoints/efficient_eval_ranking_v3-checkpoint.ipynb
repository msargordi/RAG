      " Reasoning step: To answer this question, we need to identify the primary drivers of climate change based on the provided context. The context mentions human activities as the main cause of climate change, specifically the expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\" due to human-made emissions in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: The main causes of climate change are human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other industrial processes that release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and slow heat loss to space, leading to global warming and climate change.\n",

      "1. Identify the species of swallow: The article mentions that the European (or 'Barn') swallow is the most studied species and will be used for the calculation.\n",
      "2. Determine the average mass and wing-length of the European swallow: The article states that the average mass is 20.3g and the wing-length is 0.122m (12.2cm).\n",
      "3. Estimate the amplitude and frequency of the swallow's wingbeats: The article mentions that the amplitude and frequency of the swallow's wingbeats have not been extensively studied, so estimates will be made based on similar birds.\n",
      "4. Use the Strouhal ratio to estimate the airspeed velocity: The Strouhal ratio is an equation that estimates the airspeed velocity of a bird based on the frequency of wingbeats, amplitude, and airspeed.\n",
